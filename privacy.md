# TempAPP Privacy Policy

**Last Updated**: February 15, 2025

TempAPP respects and protects your privacy. All functional data (including temperature records 35.0-39.5Â°C and measurement timestamps) is stored locally on your device using CoreData with iOS system-level encryption (NSFileProtectionComplete). You can view or delete records at any time. Uninstalling the app will terminate all data processing. We do not collect any additional information nor transmit data to external servers. For inquiries, please contact: voderment@icloud.com (response within 7 business days). Policy updates will be notified via in-app alerts.
