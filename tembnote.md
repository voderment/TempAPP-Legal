## Origin Story

After spending several hospital stays caring for children with fever, we found the traditional way of recording temperature to be both inconvenient and unscientific. This led us to develop this APP for quickly recording temperature and observing trends, while scientifically reminding users to measure temperature on time and arrange medication schedules appropriately.
